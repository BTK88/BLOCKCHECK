# BlockCheck Block Explorer

## Overview
BlockCheck Block Explorer is an Ethereum application that operates on the Sepolia testnet. It provides users with functionalities such as checking their Ethereum balance, making transactions, and viewing the current block height. The app leverages Web3.js for balance inquiries and transaction displays, and integrates with MetaMask for executing transactions.

## Features
- **Ethereum Balance Inquiry:** Check your Ethereum balance on the Sepolia testnet.
- **Transaction Execution:** Send Ethereum to another address with confirmation.
- **Block Height Display:** View the current block height of the Ethereum blockchain on Sepolia.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Connect to MetaMask for seamless transaction execution.

## Requirements
- :fox_face: **MetaMask:** A MetaMask wallet connected to the Sepolia testnet.
- :gem: **Ethereum:** Some Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet on the Sepolia testnet for transactions.
- :microscope: **Sepolia Testnet:** Access to the Sepolia testnet.
- :green_circle: **Node.js:** Required for running the development server and the build process.
- :test_tube: **Jest:** Used for Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure code quality.
